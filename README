SpinDec - C++ library for spin decoherence
==========================================

Calculates the many-body dynamics of a central spin system coupled to an interacting quantum spin bath.

Implements:

- Cluster correlation expansion
- Special methods for donor qubits

Installation
------------

Requirements:

- [Eigen]: Open-source linear algebra package
- Optional: Lapack

```sh
mkdir spindec
cd spindec
hg clone http://www.bitbucket.org/sbalian/spindec .
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will build the library and some tests. Tested on Linux and Mac OS X.

- Modify spindec/CMakeLists.txt to customize.
- Eigen can take advantage of MKL.

Usage
-----

Add #include <SpinDec/base.h> in your source and link with libspindec.

Getting help
------------

- Help is given in header files (.h extension).
- Source files (.cpp extension) may contain more information, usually geared more towards implementation.
- Main source files also contain helpful comments.
- see tests/test_cce for a good example.

History
-------

SpinDec is based on bits and pieces of old code for certain spin baths and central spin systems. These were written by Seto Balian starting in 2011. Methods used to fill Hamiltonian matrix elements efficiently were originally written in Fortran by Tania Monteiro. This version was started on 19/05/2013.
