SpinDec - Spin Decoherence Simulator
====================================

C++ library for modelling decoherence of a central spin system in a quantum spin bath.

Implements:

- Cluster correlation expansion
- Special methods for donor qubits

Notes:

- Most code in C++ developed starting 2011.
- Some methods were originally written in Fortran by Tania Monteiro.
- This version was started on 19/05/2013 using code developed for a limited set of central spin systems and spin baths.

Installation
------------

Requirements:

- Eigen: Open-source linear algebra package
  http://eigen.tuxfamily.org

```sh
mkdir spindec
cd spindec
hg clone http://www.bitbucket.org/sbalian/spindec .
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will build the library and some tests.

- Modify spindec/CMakeLists.txt to customize.
- Eigen can take advantage of MKL.

Usage
-----

Add #include <SpinDec/base.h> in your source and link with libspindec.

Getting help
------------

- Help is given in header files (.h extension).
- Source files (.cpp extension) may contain more information, usually geared more towards implementation.
- Main source files also contain helpful comments.
