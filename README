SpinDec - C++ library for spin decoherence
==========================================

Solves for the many-body dynamics of a central spin system coupled to an interacting quantum spin bath.

- Implements the cluster correlation expansion.
- Includes special methods for donor qubits in silicon.

Installation
------------

Requirements:

- [Eigen]: Open-source linear algebra package.
- Optional: Blas and Lapack.

```sh
mkdir spindec
cd spindec
hg clone http://www.bitbucket.org/sbalian/spindec .
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will build the library and some tests. Move the library and headers to your favourite location and make sure your compiler knows about them. SpinDec has been tested on Linux and Mac OS X.

- Modify spindec/CMakeLists.txt to customize.
- Eigen can take advantage of Intel MKL.

Usage
-----

Include the SpinDec/base.h header in your source and link with libspindec.

Version
-------

0.9 (late-stage beta - debugged, tested, profiled, optimized)

Getting help
------------

- Help is given in header files (.h extension).
- Source files (.cpp extension) may contain more information, usually geared more towards implementation.
- Main source files also contain helpful comments.
- see tests/test_cce for a good example.

History
-------

SpinDec is based on bits and pieces of old code for certain spin baths and central spin systems. These were written by Seto Balian starting in 2011. Methods used to efficiently fill Hamiltonian matrix elements were originally written in Fortran by Tania Monteiro. This version was started on May 19, 2013.
