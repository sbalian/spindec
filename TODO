- Const data members and use of vectors, e.g. for Spin?
  Use boost::ptr_vector to overcome problems with vector, e.g. in SpinVector?
- BoostEigen -> proper extension of Eigen? See Eigen documentation
- Make BoostEigen methods to work on Eigen base types
- return Type& for speed?
- In diagonalize zheev w[n] - use "new"?
- ../src/SpinInteraction.cpp:15: warning: abstract virtual 'virtual double SpinInteraction::calculate_non_spatial_dependence() const' called from constructor
- generalise to non-uniform magnetic fields
- more comments and provide some sort of consistent documentation
- how to properly deal with Eigen dynamic allocation, e.g. MatrixXXd
- make sure ArrayXd vs ArrayXXd setting one to another works as expected ...
- Add support for eigenvalues and eigenvectors for non-Hamiltonian operators
