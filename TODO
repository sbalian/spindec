- Const data members and use of vectors, e.g. for Spin?
  Use boost::ptr_vector to overcome problems with vector, e.g. in SpinVector?
- BoostEigen -> proper extension of Eigen? See Eigen documentation
- Make BoostEigen methods to work on Eigen base types
- return Type& for speed?
- In diagonalize zheev w[n] - use "new"?
