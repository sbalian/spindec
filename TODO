- BoostEigen -> proper extension of Eigen? See Eigen documentation
- Make BoostEigen methods to work on Eigen base types
- return Type& for speed?
- In diagonalize zheev w[n] - use "new"?
- ../src/SpinInteraction.cpp:15: warning: abstract virtual 'virtual double SpinInteraction::calculate_non_spatial_dependence() const' called from constructor
- generalise to non-uniform magnetic fields
- more comments and provide some sort of consistent documentation
- how to properly deal with Eigen dynamic allocation, e.g. MatrixXXd. e.g. initialisation of data members in constructors
- make sure ArrayXd vs ArrayXXd setting one to another works as expected ...
- Add support for eigenvalues and eigenvectors for non-Hamiltonian operators
- Better const correctness (particularly with data members) and resolve issues with std::vector. Now relies on public set methods ...
- Throw exceptions (kill Errors.h)
- Virtual destructors also for derived classes?
- Print methods
- Avoid algebra involving different orders of magnitude
- Return "size_t" for vector sizes? Like in STL? (machine dependence)
- Default constructors (and destructors ...)
- More comments + documentation
